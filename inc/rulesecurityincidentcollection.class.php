/**
 * Required, not optional — same class of surprise as `PluginSecurityincidentsSecurityIncidentCost`/
 * `PluginSecurityincidentsSecurityIncidentTemplate` (see their own docblocks):
 * `CommonItilObject_Item::prepareInputForAdd()` unconditionally calls
 * `CommonITILObject::getRuleCollectionClassInstance()`, which builds the expected class name as
 * `'Rule' . static::getType() . 'Collection'` and throws a `RuntimeException` if it doesn't exist
 * — confirmed live, the very first attempt to link an asset to an incident (the "Item" tab) fataled
 * with exactly that error. Minimal shape, mirroring GLPI core's own `RuleChangeCollection` — no
 * predefined business rules are seeded, this only satisfies the convention so linking an asset
 * doesn't crash; an administrator can still define real rules from **Configuration > Rules**
 * (`Plugin::registerClass()` in setup.php makes this itemtype discoverable there) if that
 * capability turns out to be wanted, without any further code change.
