// Required, not optional — the timeline's "add a task" action posts here by convention
// (`<itemtype in lowercase>task.form.php`, same as core's own front/changetask.form.php /
// front/tickettask.form.php). Missing entirely until now: confirmed live, adding a task from the
// incident's own timeline 404'd. Delegates to GLPI core's shared generic controller, same as every
// core ITIL task front controller does — no plugin-specific logic needed.
